                <a
                  href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gean.12316"

                  Comber et al. (2022) </a
                >, I wanted to know more about Geographically Weighted
                Regression (GWR), a regression analysis that can detect if and
                how relationships between the response and predictor variables
                vary across different geographical locations. Thus, I decided to
                use Comber's workflow and carry out my own GWR analysis, which
                assessed how topographic variables, such as elevation and slope,
                influence moisture between a forested and an open-spaced
                agricultural area. <br />

                <br />
                Since I would struggle to find areas specifically used for
                agroforestry via satellite imagery, I focused on the area
                surrounding the Finca Luna Nueva Lodge in Costa Rica (see
                <b>Figure 1</b>), known for its regenerative farming practices.
                Here, I identified two sites: Site A, surrounding the lodge,
                covered in approximately 61% forest cover, and Site B, roughly
                ten kilometers to the east, consisting mostly of sparse
                vegetation and open fields, with 19.4% forest cover. Both study
                sites are approximately 6,500 m² in area.

                For this investigation, I used the Random Forest classification
                algorithm to detect land use and land cover classes (<b
                  >Figure 2</b
                >) from my Sentinel-2 data and extracted values in a NDMI, where
                the agricultural classes overlapped. From these initial steps, I
                was able to gather all the necessary variables to carry out my
                GWR analysis, allowing me to gain a strong understanding of the
                work and steps needed to perform such an analysis.

                This was far from perfect, as I faced many unforeseen obstacles.
                For one, my study area in the tropics was persistently covered
                by clouds, and the differing topography of my study areas made
                comparability difficult both spatially and temporally.
                Nevertheless, this project was a valuable learning experience,
                as I learned what factors need to be considered for a successful
                GWR analysis.

                <p><b>Figure 3</b> shows changes in the relationship strength between the target variable (moisture values) and predictor variables (such as Slope, Aspect, or Flow direction). For instance, in Site A, Flow direction shows significant spatial fluctuations, with significant (<0.05) negative values at the top of the study area, indicating a non-random negative relationship with moisture. In contrast, Site B consistently shows insignificant results for Flow direction.</p>
