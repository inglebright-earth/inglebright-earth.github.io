            A comparison of moisture between two distinct agricultural settings
            (Forested vs. Open agriculture) - 2023
          </h2>
        </header>
        <section>
          <p>
            This study was a preliminary investigation aimed at exploring the
            viability of a potential idea for my master’s thesis—specifically,
            whether agroforestry practices in tropical regions might offer
            greater resilience to drought than open-field monocultures. By
            comparing soil moisture dynamics between two distinct agricultural
            settings in Costa Rica—<em>forested agriculture</em> (Site A) and
            <em>open-spaced agriculture</em> (Site B)—the study sought to
            understand how topographic variation and vegetation cover influence
            moisture retention.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using Sentinel-2 data, land use and land cover were classified with
            97.32% accuracy through a Random Forest model. Moisture levels were
            quantified using the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI),
            and spatial regression models—<em>OLS, GWR, and MGWR</em>—were
            applied to assess how topographic variables (slope, aspect,
            elevation, and flow direction) correlate with moisture patterns.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although NDMI values showed only marginal differences between the
            two sites, topographic factors were found to interact with moisture
            levels in complex, spatially variable ways. The MGWR model was the
            most effective in capturing these nuances by allowing relationships
            to vary across space and scale.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Challenges</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Persistent cloud cover prevented time-series analysis, limiting
              insights to a single date.
            </li>
            <li>
              Site selection was not optimal; terrain differences between sites
              complicated direct comparison.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lack of local knowledge (e.g., crop types, irrigation practices)
              made NDMI interpretation difficult.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 20m resolution of Sentinel-2 may have been too coarse to
              capture fine-scale terrain effects.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Despite these limitations, the study was highly valuable in shaping
            my understanding of the topic, highlighting methodological
            considerations and identifying areas needing refinement. It
            underscores the importance of temporal data, careful site selection,
            and local context when investigating the potential role of
            agroforestry in climate resilience.
